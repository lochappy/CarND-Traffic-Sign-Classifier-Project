    "#### 1. Describe how, and identify where in your code, you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this step is contained in the 5th code cell of the IPython notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, I decided to euqualize the histogram of the images using [Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization](http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_histograms/py_histogram_equalization/py_histogram_equalization.html) because I realized that the most of the images were taken at very low contrast condition.\n",

    "\n",
    "As the dataset has provided the validation and test set, I just used them without splitting the training data further. Instead, I focused more on augmenting to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sixth code cell of the IPython notebook contains the code for augmenting the data set. My augmentation followed the one suggested in [this paper](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf). Specifically, the data was randomly rotated in [-16,16] degrees, shifted in [-5,5] pixels, and scaled in [0.8,1.2]. In addition, the color of images was also distorted with RGB values in [-10,10] magnitude. The augmentation was performed 10 times in the original data, making the 10 times increasment of the number of training data.\n",

Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "My architecture was similar to the one described in [this paper](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf), which exploited the multiscale feature maps of the CNN to improve the overall accuracy of the models. Remarkably, instead of using dropout, which actually harmed the perfomance, this architecture used the skip connection, which connected the feature map of the second convolutional layer directly to the 4th one. As a result, this connection let the information of smaller scale, which could vanish through the pooling layer, flow directly to the fully connected layer, making the model more scale-invariant.\n",
